Earlier today I explained the idea of a Fourier series to my grandma in terms of [epicycles](https://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html). When I was done she asked

## Why the hell did Fourier come up with this?

Joseph Fourier was studying the behavior of heat. Heat behaves according to the Diffusion Equation

$$ \textcolor{green}{\frac{\partial }{\partial t}}u \propto \textcolor{orange}{\nabla^2} u $$

This rule says that <b style="color:green">over time</b>, an object's temperature moves towards the <b style="color:orange">average of its neighbors</b>.

Here's another situation governed by the diffusion equation. Imagine a social experiment where you arrange 30 [sheeple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_behavior#Sheeple) in a circle, cut them off from communication with the outside world, and force them to discuss their opinions of the president with their neighbors.

 If you polled each citizen on their rating of the president on a scale of 1-100 before and after those conversations, and you found that afterwards each citizen had updated their opinions to be 30% closer to their neighbors, then you could say that this system is governed by the diffusion equation. 

## Fourier's question and limited answer.
Fourier wanted to be able to deduce how distributions of heat evolve with time. Theoretically, knowing the initial distribution of temperature, in addition to the rule for how they evolve, should be sufficient to deduce the temperature distribution at any time in the future. Mathematically, you're on the hunt for a function $$u(x,t)$$ which satisfies the two equations

$$
\begin{equation}
u(x,0) = f(x), 
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}
\label{eq:oneDHeat}
\end{equation}
$$

for some known function $f(x)$.

Or, if you wanted to know the distribution of political views in a 3-dimensional prison packed tightly with sheep, it would be sufficient to ask them their initial opinions, muzzle them so that their plaintive bleats could be heard only by their nearest neighbors, and then measure the number of interactions they have with their neighboring sheep.

## Getting back on track
For the special case where $$f(x) = e^{inx}$$, you can use Separation of Variables to find the solution

$$u(x,t) = e^{inx}e^{-n^2t}$$

MOREOVER, since the equation \eqref{eq:oneDHeat} is linear, whenever the initial condition $$f$$ can be written as

$$ f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n e^{inx} $$

the function

$$ u(x,t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n e^{inx}e^{-n^2t} $$

solves the Initial Value Problem. The first series above is called a Fourier Series, and it's not clear at all whether there exists $$a_n \in \mathbb{C}$$ so that the sum converges to $$f$$. That question is the central focus of the next two chapters.
