# Stein-Shakarchi.Fourier
An interactive notebook for the Princeton Lectures in Analysis, Vol I


### Requirements
- files should be written in markdown (with possible syntax extensions)
- It should be possible to write LaTeX equations using $ and $$
- I should be able to write editable and executable python code blocks (potentially insecure, but whatever)
- I should be able to embed animations (shouldn't be too hard)

## Target Schedule
# By Mar. 1
- A jekyll site should be running

# By Mar. 15
- I should be able to write LaTeX equations

- By using the pre-built chirpy theme, all that was wrapped up in a couple hours



### Instructions to Build Locally
- [install ruby and jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
